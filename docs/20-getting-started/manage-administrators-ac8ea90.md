<a name="loioac8ea9038194457a9e5a34c93c5da68c__steps_afl_4xj_3xb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Navigate to *Users & Authorizations* \> *Administrators* and select your user.

3.  Under *Configure Authorizations* view your predefined authorizations and manage them according to your needs.

    For more information, see [List Administrators](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/list-administrators?version=Cloud) and [Edit Administrator Authorizations](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/edit-administrator-authorizations?version=Cloud).

4.  Create additional user administrators.

    > ### Note:  
    > When the SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant is initially provisioned to your organization, only one user is added as a tenant administrator. After that, due to possible legal and security issues, SAP adds additional tenant administrators only in exceptional cases \(for example, the existing administrator left the company, or for some reason there is no active administrator for this tenant\). To avoid access related issues in such cases, it is always a good practice for you to assign more than one administrators. Adding additional ones is exclusively in the responsibility of the current tenant administrators.

    For more information, see [Add User as Administrator](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/add-administrators?version=Cloud&q=%22person%22#loio1dc498bff0674743a1a3a0ec3f0bf298)

5.  **Optional:** Manage the predefined authorizations of the additional administrators.

    For more information, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/edit-administrator-authorizations?version=Cloud)

6.  **Optional:** Define authorization policies to further control what data administrators can access.

    For more information, see [\(Beta\) Configure Authorizations Based on Policies](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/beta-configure-authorizations-based-on-policies?version=Cloud)

7.  **Optional:** Create system administrators.

    For more information, see [Add System as Administrator](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/add-administrators?version=Cloud&q=%22person%22#loiocefb742a36754b18bbe5c3503ac6d87c)
