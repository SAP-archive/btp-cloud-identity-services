# SAML 2.0

The Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) version 2.0 is a standard for the communication of assertions about principals, typically users. The assertion can include the means by which a subject was authenticated, attributes associated with the subject, and an authorization decision for a given resource.

The two main components of a SAML 2.0 landscape are an identity provider and a service provider. The service provider is a system entity that provides a set of Web applications with trust management capabilities. The identity provider is a system entity that manages identity information for principals and provides authentication services to other trusted service providers. In other words, the service providers outsource the job of authenticating the user to the identity provider. The identity provider maintains the list of service providers where the user is logged in and passes on logout requests to those service providers.
