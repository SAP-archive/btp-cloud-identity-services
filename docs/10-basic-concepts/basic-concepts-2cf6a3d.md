# Basic Concepts

Get an overview of SAP Cloud Identity Services concepts, including the tenants, applications and bundles, as well as identity protocols \(OpenID Connect and SAML 2.0\), provisioning systems, properties, users and transformations.

-   **[Tenants](tenants-e52769f.md "A tenant refers to your (customer-specific) instance of SAP Cloud Identity
			Services. It's delivered to you as part of a bundle with an SAP cloud solution

-   **[Applications](applications-1dc32d1.md "An application is associated with a consumer of Identity
                                Authentication as an identity
		provider. This consumer could be for example an SAP cloud solution, a third-party
		application, SAP BTP subaccount,
		or the SAP Cloud Identity Services
		administration console.")**  
An application is associated with a consumer of Identity Authentication as an identity provider. This consumer could be for example an SAP cloud solution, a third-party application, SAP BTP subaccount, or the SAP Cloud Identity Services administration console.
-   **[Bundles](bundles-c1550b6.md "A bundle is a group of preconfigured products and services which are sold
		together.")**  
A bundle is a group of preconfigured products and services which are sold together.
-   **[OpenID Connect](openid-connect-a789c9c.md "You can use Identity Authentication for authentication in OpenID
		Connect protected applications.")**  
You can use Identity Authentication for authentication in OpenID Connect protected applications.
-   **[SAML 2.0](saml-2-0-0708833.md "")**  

-   **[Users](users-47bd58e.md "Users in SAP Cloud Identity Services fall into two categories: administrators and end
		users.")**  
Users in SAP Cloud Identity Services fall into two categories: administrators and end users.
-   **[Provisioning Systems](provisioning-systems-3f6182d.md "Identity Provisioning provides
		connectors to various business applications for provisioning and deprovisioning of users and
		groups. These business applications are configured as provisioning systems in the SAP Cloud Identity Services administration
		console.")**  
Identity Provisioning provides connectors to various business applications for provisioning and deprovisioning of users and groups. These business applications are configured as provisioning systems in the SAP Cloud Identity Services administration console.
-   **[Properties](properties-ca9c2bc.md "Properties hold the configuration of a provisioning system.")**  
Properties hold the configuration of a provisioning system.
-   **[Transformations](transformations-7d2a974.md "Transformations help you transform user and group attributes from the data model of the
		source system to the data model of the target system.")**  
Transformations help you transform user and group attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system.
